		<h1>Dylan Kriz</h1>
		<h2>Summary</h2>
		<p>
			In my six years of tutoring and teaching the SAT and ACT to high schoolers here in Georgia, I discoved a
			passion and joy in educating others that has never left. After a brief sabbatical from teaching full time, I
			realized that I missed it more than I thought possible, and as such have decided to pursue a full time
			career as a high school level mathematics teacher.
